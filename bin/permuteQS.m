%  Usage: A = permuteQS(A, P [,'conj'])
%
%      permute input QSpace using given permutation P.
%
%      Optional trailing 'conj' also applies (complex) conjugation
%      (note that this also affects real QSpaces in that qdir and
%      itags are altered!).
%
%      For convenience, P [,'conj'] may also be represented as
%      single string, e.g. [2 1],'conj' is equivalent to '2,1;*'
%      or '21*' where the convention on string notation
%      follows that of contraction indices [ctrIdx].
%
%      NB! [06/02/2019] the provided permutation can be shorter
%      than the rank of the QSpace; in this case it only affects the
%      leading range of indices, i.e., acts like an identity
%      on the remainder of indices.
