%  Usage: [E [,I]]= eigQS(H [,opts])
%
%      Obtain eigenspectrum and eigenbasis of input 'Hamiltonian' H
%      in QSpace represenation. The eigendecomposition is split into
%      kept (K) and discarded (D) state space, as governed by the
%      truncation parameters Nkeep and Etrunc (for actual Hamiltonians)
%      or Rtrunc (for density matrices R:=H).
%
%  Options
%
%     'Nkeep',..  max. number of states to keep (default: -1 = keep all)
%     'Etrunc',.. keep states according to energy truncation criteria
%                 with E<=E0+Etrunc (default: <=0 = ignore; note that
%                 Etrunc is interpreted relative to lowest eigenvalue
%                 E0 = min[eig(H)]).
%     'Rtrunc',.. keep states according to truncation criteria of
%                 reduced density matrix with eig(R)>Rtrunc with R:=H
%                 (this is alternative to Etrunc and thus ignored by
%                 default; note, furthermore, that here Rtrunc is
%                 interpreted absolute, i.e. as is).
%     'deps',..   allow to keep (close to) degenerate spaces together
%                 (default: 0, i.e. sharp truncation e.g. with Nkeep)
%
%  Output
%
%      E contains the full sorted eigenspectrum (1st column),
%      and in the presence of non-abelian symmetries, the overall
%      multiplet degeneracy as a 2nd column.
%
%      The output/info structure I contains the fields
%
%       .AK, .AD  for kept and discarded state space
%       .EK, .ED, for kept and discarded eigen spectrum (diag)
%       .DB       block dimension of input Hamiltonian H in terms
%                 of multiplets (1st col) and states (last col).
%       .NK       actual number of kept multiplets / states.
%       .Etrunc or
%       .Rtrunc   actual truncation treshold used
