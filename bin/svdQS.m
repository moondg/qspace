%  Usage #1:
%  [U,S,Vd,[,info]] = svdQS(PSI,idx [,OPTS]);
%
%     Compute SVD decomposition of QSpace object PSI, where the
%     indices idx are split off into Vd, and the remaining indices
%     into U, which are '>>' and '<<'  orthonormalized, respectively
%     (i.e. are unitaries or isometries generated from the SVD.
%     Typically, the indices in PSI are 'all-in'.
%
%     Note that the 3rd argument returns Vd:=V' and not V,
%     i.e. already includes the dagger such that PSI = U*S*Vd
%     e.g., similar to the LAPACK convention, cf. zgesdd.
%
%     By convention, if a single index is split off, U maintains
%     the index order of PSI. For rank r=2 then, the case idx=2
%     behaves the expected way. However, for idx=1 the transpose
%     Ut=U^t is returned for U, having PSI = [Ut*S*Vd]^t =
%     contract(S*Vd,1,U,1).
%
%     For non-abelian symmetries, idx is required to be a single
%     index (or conversely, all indices but one). If PSI is grouped
%     into two sets of indices each of which has more than one index,
%     then indices need to be fused prior to calling svdQS.
%     Also, in this case of a single index specified, U always
%     resembles PSI, i.e. has the same rank and index order.
%
%  Usage #2 (deprecated):
%  [U,S,V',[,info]] = svdQS(A1, A2, ic1, ic2 [,OPTS]);
%
%     Compute SVD decomposition of QSpace object PSI=A1*A2,
%     where '*' stands for the contraction (A1,ic1,A2,ic2).
%     The split occurs between the remaining indices in A1
%     and the remaining indices in A2. This indices are typically
%     'all-in', while the index/indices ic1 to be contracted
%     with ic2 can have any initial orientation. There will
%     always be a single new intermediate connecting index
%     between A1 and A2.
%
%  Input
%
%     PSI      or PSI=A1*A2, where
%     A[12]    are two nearest neighbor tensor
%     ic[12]   that share the common index specified by ic1 and ic2.
%
%  OPTIONS
%
%    'Nkeep',.. max. number of states/multiplets to keep (-1: all)
%    'Nkmin',.. min. number of states/multiplets to keep on index
%               connecting A1 to A2 (default: 0, i.e. no lower bound)
%    'stol',... absolute tolerance on SVD i.e. on sqrt(rho)
%               default: 1E-8 if Nkeep is not set, 0 otherwise.
%    'itag',... itag on newly generated index
%    'disp'     display info to stdout
%
%  OUTPUT
%
%    A1(2)   updated and properly orthonormalized A1(2)
%    info      info structure containing
%     .SVD     singular value data blocked within QS symmetry space
%     .svd     vectorized singular value data
