%  Usage: [D[,D2]] = getDimQS(A)
%
%      get full dimension of given QSpace object.
%
%      In case of non-abelian symmetries, usage #2 returns
%      number of multipets as D, and the full state space
%      dimension as 2nd argument D2.
%
%      NB! if no second output argument (D2) is requested,
%      this routine returns D if D==D2 (e.g. which is always
%      the case of abelian symmetries) but [D;D2] if D!=D2.
