%  Usage 1: E=getIdentityQS(A [,i1, perm,'-[0z]']);
%
%     get plain identity operator from given QSpace.
%     corresponding to the state space on index i1 with A.
%
%  Options
%
%   '-0'  this generates the 1J symbol, i.e. an identity operator
%         with all indices inward. This can be used to "revert arrows",
%         with the effect that the second index on E carries the
%         *dual* state space with respect to the first index.
%
%         For this reason, the respective itag, as inherited from A @ i1,
%         if non-empty, is also changed by flagging it with a trailing
%         prime ('). Therefore in order to accommodate for this additional
%         character, the itag in A @ i1 must have less than 8 chars in length.
%         This flag is considered part of the itag, hence overall
%         such a flagged itag is considered different from the original.
%         The flagging also acts like a toggle, i.e., marking an
%         itag that is flagged already, removes the trailing prime.
%  
%         For readability, the QSpace display shows such `marked'
%         itags in color gray while hiding the trailing prime.
%         This behavior can be turned off by setting the environmental
%         variable QS_LOG_COLOR to zero (default: 1).
%
%   '-z'  same as '-0' but without flagging the itag in E @ index 2.
%
%  Usage 2: A=getIdentityQS(A [,i1 [,ta]], B [,i2 [,tb], t3, perm]);
%
%     get tensor product space of input spaces defined by
%     A and B. If i[12] is not specified, rank-2 objects
%     are assumed taking (the first) two indizes.
%
%     Default index order of the output space is (1,2,12*)
%     with the itags of A and B inherited if present.
%     An itag t3 for the combined output space (dim3) may be
%     specified. By default, a conj flag if present in t3
%     will be ignored, with the following exception:
%
%     [06/01/2019] In addition, for an input A-tensor with LRs
%     index order convention, its itags may be inherited to C
%     by specifying <ta> xor <tb> (see usage above) in the format
%     '-A[:..]' where `..' indicates extra characters to be
%     concatenated at the end of the itag for the *un*fused [LR]
%     index in A or B for <ta> xor <tb>, respectively.
%
%     For example, consider an A-tensor with itags {K01,K02*,s02},
%     and E a local identity operator without itags; then in order
%     to ensure a complete local state space, one may use
%     >> getIdentityQS(A,1,'-A:~',E)
%     which generates a QSpace with itags {K01,s02,K02~*}.
%     K01 is inherited from A via `A@1'; the remaining two itags
%     are derived from the remaining two itags in A;
%     therefore `A,i' must have i=1 or 2 with in LRs index order.
%     conj-flags are properly adjusted as needed.
%     Conversely, getIdentityQS(A,2,'-A:~',E)
%     generates itags {K02,s02,K01~*}, e.g. used for R->L sweep.
%
%     [08/2023] The itag t3 on the fused index may be written
%     in the flagged format '...' -> '-m:...'  or  '-m!...'
%     which interprets trailing marker (') and conj (*) flags
%     in the sense described for '-m:..' here (the behavior is
%     simply reversed w.r.t. to the conjugate flag for '-m!..'):
%     When inserting an identity the fused space may already
%     refer to a particular existing itag for that leg.
%     From the perspective of the rank-3 identity A-tensor
%     generated here, if t3 has a trailing conj marker, it already
%     reflects an outgoing index, and hence can be kept. However,
%     if t3 does not have a trailing conj flag, then the identity
%     generated here effectively reverts the arrow. As such
%     it rather refers to the dual space. In order to reflect
%     this in the fused space, the itag t3 will `marked' as
%     dual state space which by QSpace convention is indicated
%     by a trailing prime (') as part of the itag, hence before
%     the conj flag. This acts as a toggle, i.e., if a trailing
%     prime is already present in t3, adding another one
%     rather removes it, instead.
%
%  Finally, the output index order may be changed by specifying
%  a permutation perm to be applied on the final object.
%  If itag is not specified, perm must be in numerical format,
%  otherwise a (compact) string format is also accepted.
%
%  Further options
%
%    '-h'  display this usage and exit
%    '-v'  verbose
%
%  Note that mex files do not allow to return class objects,
%  hence A is returned as a QSpace structure. To get a class
%  object, use QSpace(getIdentityQS(...)), or equivalently,
%  if getIdentity() is properly defined as a wrapper routine
%  within matlab's Class/@QSpace (see MPS Pack), having a QSpace
%  input A, this may be shortended to getIdentity(A,...).
