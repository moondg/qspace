%           NRGWilsonQS(H0, A0, Lambda, ff, FC, Z, [, gg, FL, OPTS])
%
%  NRG run using (non-)Abelian symmetries for a Wilson chain of length L
%  based on the standard iterative diagonalization prescription.
%
%  The routine perfoms a quick check whether any of the inputs is complex.
%  This includes the QSpaces H0, A0, FC, FL (if preseent), or the hopping
%  amplitudes ff. If so, NRGWilsonQS runs in full complex arithmetic,
%  thus returning complex AK and AD. The subsequent fdmNRG_QS also can
%  deal with either case. All routines use double precision throughout.
%
%     H0      impurity / starting Hamiltonian (rank-2 QSpace)
%             H0 will be diagonalized upon initialization hence does not
%             have to be diagonal on input. The resulting basis
%             transformation is multiplied onto A0.
%
%     A0      basis used for H0 in LRs order (rank-3 QSpace)
%             where the local space s(igma) must already have the
%             (equivalent) space of a Wilson site (note that A0 is used
%             to obtain the matrix elements of FC at the first iteration.
%
%     Lambda  used to rescale H_k by sqrt(Lambda); therefore this should be
%             consistent with the Lambda used to obtain ff and gg below
%
%     ff      strength of couplings along Wilson chain as they appear in
%             the physical Hamiltonian, i.e. they must not be rescaled yet,
%             as this is done automaticely based on Lambda! if ff is a vector
%             of length L-1, the coupling applies for all nearest-neighbor
%             hoppings via the FC operators in a diagonal fashion.     ^1)
%             If ff is a matrix of dimension (L-1) x Nf, the diagonal
%             hopping matrix elements can differ across the FC operators.
%             If ff is a matrix of dimension (L-1) x (Nf*Nf), this also
%             permits to encode cross-couplings FC(i)'*FC(j) in between
%             nearest-neighbor shells.
%
%             NB! The length L of the Wilson chain is deterimend by the
%             length of ff, i.e. L=length(ff)+1 by including A0.
%
%     FC      set of Nf annihilation operators used for coupling (QSpace)
%             e.g. in case of all-abelian symmetries (default) this becomes
%             H = F1'*ZF2 + F1*(ZF2)' + h.conj. (zflag=1, see below)
%             with F1=F2=FC such that this operator alway appears as 
%             a bilinear together with its hermitian conjugate.  ^2)
%
%     Z       (diagonal) operator required for the calculation of the
%             fermionic hopping matrix elements (QSpace). It is defined by
%             ferminonic signs (-1)^ns required in the context as described
%             for FC above, where ns is the number of fermionic particles
%             for the local states s(igma).
%  Options
%
%     zflag   variation of how to apply the fermionic signs Z on the
%             hopping terms in the Hamilonian determined by the operators
%             FC (default: 1 e.g. as described for FC above in the context
%             of all-abelian quantum numbers). Valid settings:
%
%             0: ignore Z alltogether
%             1: H = F1'*(Z*F2) + F1*(Z*F2)' + hermitian conjugate (default)
%             2: intended for particle-hole-symmetric cases only:
%                H = (ZF1)'*(ZF2) at every second iteration only, WITHOUT
%                adding a further hermitian conjugate (already included!)
%                starting with NO Z-operators applied to A0.local (i.e.
%                same as for zflag==1), therefore starting with F1'*F1
%                at first iteration (i.e. using F1 to update operators,
%                and again F1 when building enlarged Hamiltonian.
%                For every other iteration, H = (Z*F1)'*(Z*F2) is applied
%                using Z with BOTH operators, consistent with particle-
%                hole symmetry!
%             3: same as zflag=2, but Z is applied at every other iteration
%                already starting with the very first iteration.
%
%     FL      set of Nl local operators along the chain (QSpaces [Nl])
%
%     gg      strength of local operators FL along the chain similar to ff
%             i.e. not rescaled! (double, (L-1) x Nl, not including H0)  ^1)
%             Note that local operators can always be expressed as
%             Hermitian operators, with real amplitudes gg. Hence gg is
%             always expected to be real.
%
%  ^1) NB! if the couplings ff (or also gg) are the same for all FC and FL,
%      they may be represented by a single vector only.
%
%  ^2) FC and FL are considered the same for every interation throughout
%      the Wilson chain, yet there strength is modified by ff and gg,
%      respectively.
%
%  Further options / flags
%
%   'Nkeep',. max number of states to keep at every NRG iteration (512)
%   'NKEEP',. vector that specifies Nkeep individually for first few sites
%
%   'Etrunc', use given energy threshold rather than Nkeep to trunctate
%             unless Nkeep is reached (<=0 uses Nkeep only; default: 0).
%   'ETRUNC', vector that specifies Etrunc individually for first few sites
%   'ET1'     Etrunc for 1st with trunctation (default: 1.2*Etrunc)
%             if ET1<0, then ET1=Etrunc is used.
%
%   'FNfac',. global factor on energy scale, i.e.
%             EScale(n) = Lambda^(-n/2) * 0.5*(Lambda+1) * FNfac.
%             (by default, FNfac is chosen such that ff(N-1)/EScale(N)=1;
%             see returned info.EScale below)
%
%   'Estop',. stop dynamically once stable fixed point is reached, i.e.
%             energies EK(1:Nkept/4) for iterations k and k+2 are the same
%             to within given value for Estop (default: 0, i.e. not used).
%   '-Estop'  same as 'Estop',1E-4
%
%   'NEE',..  number of states to store for energy flow diagram (Nkeep*Ns)
%   'fout',.  store data for every site into output file <fout>_##.mat
%             if specified, the first RETURN argument is skipped (./NRG/NRG).
%   'deps',.. restore degeneracy within eps (1E-12)
%   'db',..   require minimum distance towards discarded energies (-1)
%             (db<0 searches for maximum distance in vicinity of Nkeep)
%   'dmax'..  maximum number of extra states to include for db (Nkeep/10)
%             (mostly a safeguard in case db has been set too large).
%   '-IdF'    build local Id from F-ops, fully ignoring A0 (NB! by default,
%             sigma-space of A0 is considered a proper Wilson bath site!)
%   'ionly'   info only (incl. Eflow) i.e. do not store iterative NRG data
%   '-v'      verbose mode
%
%  Output
%
%   NRG_DATA  MPS data (only if 'fout' was not specified; otherwise this
%             data is stored into specified file structure):
%
%    .A[KD]   states K(ept) / D(iscarded) at current NRG iteration
%             according to NRG truncation scheme (rank-3 QSpaces in LRs order)
%    .H[KD]   eigenenergies corresponding to the eigenbasis of AK/AD;
%             stored in diagonal format.
%
%   info      info structure containing the following fields:
%
%    .istr    info string
%    .usage   (struct) info such as time stamp, etc.
%    .HK      rescaled energy data for energy flow diagram (QSpace vector)
%    .EE      collected eig(HK) data (purely numerical array)
%    .E0      substracted ground state energy at energy scale of iteration
%    .EK      [largest kept, lowest and largest discarded] energy for each iteration
%    .EScale  NRG energy scale used along the Wilson chain (see FNfac above)
%    .Lambda  Lambda used in the calculation (same as input)
%    .ops     (struct) operator specific data for Wilson chain (FC,Z,ff,gg,etc.)
%    .paras   (struct) technical NRG specific internal parameters
%
%  Alternative usage: NRGWilsonQS('MATfilename')
%  NRGWilsonQS('setup.mat' [, 'fout_tag'])
%
%     This allows to read all input parameters from given setup.mat file
%     (MatLab binary) which allows pure standalone run of NRG without
%     requiring MatLab (except for the API for binary *.mat I/O).
%
%     This way all variables and options MUST be defined by their names
%     shown above; moreover, this usage must include a specification
%     for fout_tag as all output data will be written there.
%     fout_tag is either specified as 2nd argument above, else it should
%     be defined in terms of the variable 'fout' in the parameter file
%     setup.mat (default for fout_tag: './NRG/NRG').
