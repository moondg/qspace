%  Usage: S=compactQS([opts],'qtype',Q1,Q2,Q,A [,perm]);
%
%     reduce matrix elements of the rank-3 IROP.
%     Here A is still specified in full (dense) tensor format
%     with matrix elements given by
%
%        A(i1,i2,io) := <i1|A(io)|i2>
%
%     NB! this assumes the index (1,2,op) specified on the lhs!
%     The symmetry types are specified by qtype. Moreover,
%     all states i1 and i2 must be already cast into symmetry
%     eigenstate grouped into multiplets (see getSymStates.cc)
%     with q- and z-labels both present and interleaved in
%     each input state label sets Q*.
%
%     The state spaces are combined in the order (Q2+Q =>Q1),
%     thus using the Clebsch Gordan coefficients (Q1,Q|Q2).
%     This is a natural order in that, Q=-1 annihilates a
%     particle on a |ket> state (the annihilation operator
%     on a ket state increases charge, i.e. Q would be +1,
%     in case Q1 and Q had been combined into Q!).
%     This therefore represents a natural index order.
%
%  Options
%
%     perm  permutation to be applied to {Q1,Q2,Q} and A
%           prior to combining first two indizes into third.
