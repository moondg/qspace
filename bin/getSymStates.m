%  Usage #1: [U,I]=getSymStates(Sp,Sz);
%
%    get symmetry eigenstates for symmetry operations given by
%    rising operators Sp and (diagonal) z-operators Sz.
%    The order of the Sz operators determines the order of the
%    z-labels to be determined.
%
%  Usage #2: [U,I]=getSymStates(SOP)
%
%    Moreover, Sp and Sz can be grouped according to each symmetry
%    by using a single vector structure Is with the mandatory
%    fields .Sp and .Sz. In this case, an empty Sp is interpreted
%    as Abelian quantum number. Eventually Sp and Sz are combined
%    into a single sequence as in usage #1.
%
%    Further optional fields
%      .type   symmetry type (in QSpace convention)
%      .qfac   applied to all z- and q-labels (scalar or vector)
%      .jmap   subsequently to qfac, applies linear transform
%              of q-labels (square matrix)
%
%  Output: symmetry eigenstates written as full matrix in U,
%  and info structure I with the fields
%
%    basically reiterating the input
%      .R0    input .Sp and .Sz data
%      .type  symmetry type
%      .JMap  J-transformation used (identity if not specified)
%      .dz    number of z-operators for each symmetry
%
%    actual output data
%      .dd    dimension of irreduible multiplets generated
%      .RR    irreducible representations with qfac and jmap applied
%      .QZ    interleaved q- and z-labels.
%      .d2    dimensions of setup in QZ (non-abelian number have
%             the same number appearing twice)
