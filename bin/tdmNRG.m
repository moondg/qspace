%
%     time-dependent numerical renormalization group (NRG)
%     using the full thermal density matrix of the initial system
%     (FDM), rho_0, as starting configuration at time t=0.
%
%  This routine calculates the time evolution of local operators
%  C1(t)*C2 in fDM-NRG framework at given temperature T.
%
%     cc(t) = < C1(t)C2'>_0 = trace( rho_0 * C1(t) * C2')
%
%  With option -fgr the initial density matrix is modified
%  by the operator C2 (e.g. creation / deletion of a particle
%  as in absorption / emission processes) with the
%  resulting modified time evolution being
%
%     cc(t) = trace( (C2' rho_0 C2) * C1(t) )
%
%  Hence the operator C2 appears twice. Note, however, that
%  the projected density matrix C2' rho_0 C2 is no longer
%  normalized.
%
%  This routine uses data from two previous NRG runs with
%  the result written as matrix product state in QSpace format.
%  It must contain the state space kept (AK) as well as the one
%  discarded (AD) at every NRG iteration.
%
%  The inital state is determined by the density matrix rho_0 of
%  NRG0 at given temperature T. The time evolution is determined
%  within NRG2.

%
%  Input:
%
%    NRG[02]    specifies previously calclulated NRG data; if this
%               contains path/file, then the data will be read from the
%               files path/file_##.mat for every site (see NRGWilsonQS)
%
%       .AK     MPS state of k(ept) space (regular NRG, QSpace)
%       .AD     MPS state of t(runcated) NRG space (QSpace)
%       .HK     effective NRG eigenspectra (kept, QSpace)
%       .HD     effective NRG eigenspectra (truncated, QSpace)
%
%    Lambda     NRG discretization parameter for the conduction band.
%               Lambda is needed to undo the energy scaling permformed
%               in obtaining the NRG data at the first place.
%
%    C[12]      local operators, e.g. acting on the impurity
%
%    If C2 is not specified or specified as empty [], it will be
%    automatically assumed equal to the identity operator.
%
%    NB! If operators C[12] are specified by name, they will be
%    read from workspace and stored in NRG_DATA together with
%    the other NRG data (can be disabled by flag `nostore').
%
%  Options / Flags (default method: tDM)
%
%   'alpha',..  exponential decay of energies exp(-alpha dE) [0.]
%               this applies alpha in time domain (F. Anders 2005)
%   'sigma',..  applies broadening in frequency domain (log. gauss)
%               NB! either alpha or sigma can be specified but not both.
%               default: sigma=0.3 with alpha ignored.
%
%   'NRho', k   builds density matrix from iteration k only.
%   'T',...     temperature at which correlation function is calculated.
%               If not specified, the temperature T is given by the
%               energy scale towards the end of the Wilson chain.
%
%   '-fgr'      run in FGR modus applying C2 twice (see above).
%
%   'nlog',...  number of bins per decade for logarithmic discretization (256)
%   'emin',...  minimum energy for omega binning (TN/1000)
%   'emax',...  maximum energy for omega binning (10.)
%
%   'nostore'   do not store operator elements of C[12] with NRG_DATA
%   'locRho'    if Rho needs to be calculated it is stored in RAM only
%               and will be deleted after the program is finished
%   'partial'   return partial data from every NRG iteration
%   'raw'       raw data only, i.e. no smoothing of data
%   'RAW'       calculates time dependent data from exact frequency data
%               i.e. without binning of energies on log. scale
%   'disp'      more detaild output (0)
%
%    Z0         Z0 operator for first site (impurity) required for
%               fermionic setup where Z0=(-1)^(number of particles)
%   'zflags'    on which operators C[12] to apply fermionic signs Z0
%               ex. 'zflags', [ 1 0 ... ]  would apply Z0 to the first
%               but not to the second operator  (default: none).
%
%  NB! The first (last) bin contains all data below (above) emin (emax)
%
%  Output
%
%    cc         expectation value at times specified in tt
