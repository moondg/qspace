% function contractQS()
%
%     Contract set of QSpace tensors in a pairwise fashion
%     as described with usage #1 and #2 below. This automatically
%     also takes care of the underlying Clebsch Gordan coefficient
%     spaces if present based on X-symbols.
%
%     Each QSpace can be used as is, or as its 'conjugate' where the
%     conjugate of a QSpace A, i.e. conj(A) is defined as the QSpace
%
%      1) with all `arrows' reversed
%      2) keeping the SAME qlabels on all legs
%      3) and complex conjugation of all data{} if applicable,
%         i.e., if the (reduced) matrix elements are complex.
%
%     Because of (1), the specification of conjugate flags (`conj-flags')
%     is also important for QSpaces with all-real matrix elements.
%     For reversing individual arrows, see getIdentitQS(..,'-0').
%
%  Usage #1: S=contractQS(A, ica, B, icb [, perm, OPTS ]);
%
%     Plain contraction of a single pair of QSpaces, A and B,
%     with respect to given explicitly specified  sets of
%     contraction indices ica and icb, which can be specified
%
%       - numerically (e.g. [1 2]),
%       - or as strings (e.g. '1,2', or '1 2')
%       - or as compact strings (e.g. '1,2', or '12')
%
%     The last 'compact format' is only possible / unique,
%     of course, if the tensors A and B do not have more than
%     9 legs (which basically never occurs), such that the
%     contraction indices reamin in the single digits
%     (this can be further relaxed, though, by extending the
%     digital range to letter, i.e. using a-z after 0-9).
%
%     The recommended way to specify conj-flag with usage #1
%     is together with the contraction indices in string notation!
%     For example,
%
%       contractQS(A,[1 3],B,[1 3],'conjA')  is equivalent to
%       contractQS(A,'1,3;*',B,[1 3])        is equivalent to
%       contractQS(A,'13*',B,'13')
%
%     (deprecated) options specific to usage #1:
%
%       'conjA'  use complex conjugate of A for contraction
%       'conjB'  use complex conjugate of B for contraction
%
%  Usage #2: S=contractQS(A,..,{B,..,{C,..}},.. [, perm, OPTS ]);
%
%     Generalized 'cell-contraction' of tensors: when encountering
%     a cell, the content of that cell is contracted first, before
%     using its result. This allows the specification of an entire
%     patter of pairwise contractions based on a nested cell structure
%     where the lowest-level contractions are performed first.
%     An optional fully enveloping outer cell bracket at `base' level
%     as in S=contractQS({A,..,{B,..,{C,..}},..} [, perm, OPTS ])
%     is permitted, which may be used e.g., when debugging nested
%     parts of cell-contractions.
%
%     Cell contractions are furthermore based on QSpace `itags'
%     i.e. string labels for indices with up to 8chars, and which
%     are specified in QSpace.info.itags. This offers automated
%     contraction ('auto-contraction') of pairs of tensors solely
%     based on matching itags! Uusage #2 therefore does not (also)
%     allow explicit specification of contraction indices as in
%     usage #1.  Therefore itags (plus conj-flags) must be unique.
%
%     itags must always also contain individual conjugate flags
%     (this represent the bare minimum that must be specified with
%     each QSpacein v3): the conjugate flags on individual indices
%     (legs) of a tensor determine  whether that index (leg) is
%     in- or out-going, with the convention that
%
%         all out-going indices have a trailing * in their itags!
%
%     For example, an A-tensor with L(eft), R(ight), s(=local)
%     indices may have itags A.info.itags={'L','R*',s'}
%     assuming (L,R,s) index order.
%
%     In usage #2, for every operator additional optional strings
%     can be specified, appearing right after the affected tensor
%     e.g. QSpace A:
%
%       A,'*'    apply overall (complex) conjugation on given input
%                tensor A (see early comments above)
%       A,'!ij'  do not contract indices specified by ij (in compact
%                format) despite they share common matching itags.
%       A,'!ij*' both of the above in a single instruction
%                the conjugate flag '*' always trailing.
%
%       A,'ij'   [07/2023]
%       A,'ij*'  explicitly specify indices to contract
%                this is intended only for the case of degenerate itags
%                i.e., when identical itags appear on multiple legs
%                including the same conjugate flag.
%
%     itags may be set or adapted on the fly (this is performed
%     prior to the auto-contraction together wit the above directions)
%
%       X,'--op:<tag>[:<opl=op>]'
%          specify itags for given (e.g. local) operator.
%
%          The last option considers X an operator, and hence assumes
%          operator itags '<tag>;<tag>*[;opl*]' for QSpace X;
%          the default operator label is `op', but may be changed
%          by specifying a trailing ':<opl>' as indicated above.
%          As a safeguard, this issues a warning, if existing itags are
%          overwritten. This is relevant e.g. for local operators that
%          are applied to a very specific site with associated itag.
%
%          [11/2018] the specified <tag> may now also represent
%          a regular expression (regexp), recognized by non-alphabetic
%          special characters, while ignoring conj-flags (without
%          special characters, the specified <tag> is taken as is!).
%          This usage then searches for a matching itag in the paired
%          up QSpace (cell) in the contraction.
%
%          Ex. Consider A some QSpace with a single local index
%          that starts with `s', e.g., like 's010' for site 10;
%          then contract(A,Xloc,'-op:^s') will autocontract
%          the local operator Xloc to the correct local index in A
%          (here the regex `^s' indicates `starts with s');
%          An alternative operator itag may still be specified
%          by adding a trailing ':opl' as indicated earlier.
%
%       A,'--itag:s/pat/rep/[gi]   [07/2023]
%
%          replace/modify existing itags on the fly for a particular
%          recursive level of a cell contraction based on regular
%          expressions (regex; using ECMAScript grammar, cf. C++/regex).
%          The syntax is much analogous to perl regex.
%
%          The trailing flags enable case insensitive replacement [i]
%          and global replacement [g] of all possible matches
%          (by default, only the first match is replaced).
%
%     An adaptation of usage #2 can also be used
%     for plain sequential contractions
%
%         S=contractQS(A [,flagsA],B [,flagsB],C,... [, perm, OPTS ])
%
%     which is equivalent to
%     S=contractQS({A [,flagsA],{B [,flagsB], {C,...}}}, [,perm,OPTS ]).
%     That is, by grouping A*(B*(C*...)), sequential contractions start
%     from the right end onwards to the beginning of the specified set.
%     This structure is also permitted at any lower level inside cell
%     contractions. Non-contracted indices are always collected in the
%     order they appear in the input.
%
%  The remaining trailing OPTS are
%
%     perm  optional permutation (non-string) on the final object;
%           this permutation can be shorter than the actual rank
%           of the resulting QSpace, which then is completed as
%           an identity permutation on the remainder of indices.
%
%           By permitting the specification of indices to contract
%           also in contractions based on itags (cell-contractions)
%           there is a potential ambiguity of whether perm should
%           be interpreted as indices on the last specified tensor
%           (the latter may also be represented in compact string
%           format for better differentiation).
%
%           Hence the rules for perm to be interpreted as permutation
%           requires that (i) it is a valid permutation of length
%           r>=2 to start with, and (ii) that it is in numeric format,
%           i.e., not written as compact string. Valid examples are
%           [2 1], [2 3 1], but not, e.g., 1, [2 3], or '21'.
%
%           The ambiguity above is fully circumvented when also
%           wrapping the last contraction at base level into a cell,
%           such as contractQS({A,...},perm [,'-v']) [see above],
%           in which case perm is always interpreted as permutation
%           on the overall result, irrespective of rank or whether
%           specified as numeric or compact string index. In case
%           of a string, this then also permits to specify an optional
%           conjugate flag to be applied on the overall result.
%
%     '-v'  debug mode that shows all levels of a cell contraction
%           together with the actual contractions performed
%           based on shown itags. Internally, degenerate itags are
%           frequently flagged by making use of signed characters,
%           which makes them unique and thus differentiate them.
%           When printed, flagged itags are formatted as "<itag>|b"
%           where the character `|' separates the actual itag string
%           from number b (int8 decimal) which in its binary form
%           reflects the internal flags.
%
%  Mixed usage of #2 and #1 is not possible.
%  Usage #2 is typically recommended because auto-contraction
%  makes it far easier to contract entire networks in a single go
%  without having to manually track and specify index locations.

% CHANGE LOG
% -------------------------------------------------------------------- %
% [07/2023] cell-contraction now also permits
%     explicit specification of index to contract for particular
%     QSpace on compact notation such as '12' equivalent to [1 2]
%     rather than just excluding indices that could be contracted
%     based on matching itags.
%
% [07/2023] introduced '--itag:s/pat/rep/[gi]
%
% [07/2023] replaced '-op: by '--op:'
%     yet with '-op:' still permitted for backward compatibility
