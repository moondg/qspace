%  Usage: [A,n] = skipZerosQS(A [,eps,opts]);
%
%     skip data blocks that have all-zero entries to within eps
%     (default eps=1E-14). The total number of skipped blocks
%     is returned as 2nd argument.
%
%     For scalar (i.e. rank-2 block-diagonal) operators zero-
%     blocks are kept, by default (e.g. relevant for Hamiltonians
%     where states with energy zero are relevant states.
%     This can be disable by using the option '--all'.
