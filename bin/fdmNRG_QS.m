%         fdmNRG(NRG_DATA [,Inrg], B, C, Z0, [,opts])
%
%    This routine calculates arbitrary correlation function (CF)
%    in the full density matrix Numerical Renormalization Group
%    (fdm-NRG) framework at arbitrary temperature T for arbitrary
%    abelian or non-abelian symmetries.
%
%       A(w) = <B||C'>_w = FFT(<{B(t),C'}>).  (' equiv ^dagger)
%
%    If B is specified as empty [], it will be automatically assumed
%    equal to C, i.e. B=C as is the case for spectral functions;
%    anti-commutator (default) or commutator will be chosen according
%    to cflags below (see also zflags for Fermionic signs).
%
%    This routine uses data from a previous standard NRG run with
%    the result written as a matrix product state in QSpace format.
%    It must contain the state space kept (AK) as well as the one
%    thrown / discarded (AD) at every NRG iteration.
%
%  See also: NRGWilsonQS
%
%  Input:
%
%    NRG_DATA   structure containing data of previous NRG run; if this
%               contains path/file, then the data will be read from the
%               files path/file_##.mat for every site (see NRGWilsonQS)
%
%     .AK       MPS state of k(ept) space (regular NRG, QSpace)
%     .AD       MPS state of t(runcated) NRG space (QSpace)
%     .HK       effective NRG eigenspectra (kept, QSpace)
%     .HD       effective NRG eigenspectra (truncated, QSpace)
%
%    Inrg       NRG info structure (required if NRG_DATA contains
%               structure; otherwise <NRG_DATA>_info.mat will be accessed.
%               required elements within Inrg structure / data:
%
%     .Lambda   NRG discretization parameter for the conduction band.
%               Lambda is needed to undo the energy scaling permformed
%               in obtaining the NRG data at the first place.
%             
%     .EScale   energy scale fore each Wilson shell
%             
%     .E0       (relative) ground state energy offsets in the same
%               energy scales as H[KD]; this is needed for evaluating
%               the correct weights of the density matrix
%
%    B,C        operators acting on the impurity used to calculate the
%               correlation between them as in A(w)=FFT(<{B(t),C'}>).
%
%               If the operators B or C are specified by name, they
%               will be read from workspace, and stored in NRG_DATA
%               together with the other NRG MPS data (the latter is
%               disabled by the flag `nostore')
%
%               The operators in B and C are paired up for correlation
%               functions. They are applied in the order of priority
%               (whichever fits first): L, then s, then R onto A0
%               as in <NRGDATA>_00 with index order LRs where L = left,
%               R = right = combined, s = local state space sigma).
%
%    Z0         Z0 operator for the space described by B and C
%               required for fermionic setup where must represent
%               Z0=(-1)^(number of particles); Z0 is directly
%               contracted onto the B and C where 'zflags' is set.
%
%  Options / Flags (default method: fDM)
%
%   'fDM'       full-density-matrix approach to CFs (default)
%   'NRho',k,   build density matrix from single iteration k
%               (for testing purposes, only)
%
%   'T',...     temperature at which correlation function is calculated;
%               default: about an order of magnitude larger than the
%               energy scale at the end of the Wilson chain
%
%   'vflag',..  more detailed output with increasing value (default: 1)
%   'partial'   store G1 and G2 separatly (e.g. for detailed balance
%               or the calculation of expectation values)
%   'nostore'   do not store operator elements of B or C with NRG_DATA
%   'locRho'    if Rho needs to be calculated it is stored in RAM only
%               and will be deleted after the program is finished
%   'noRHO'     do not calculate Rho, eg. calculate partition function
%               only (relevant with empty ops B and C only)
%   'rhoNorm',. allows to specify the weights rhoNorm explicitely
%               as input (intended for testing purposes only)
%
%   'zflags'    on which operators in <B||C> to apply fermionic signs Z0
%               ex. 'zflags', [ 1 0 ... ]  would apply Z0 to the first
%               but not to the second operator (default: all 0 if Z0
%               is empty, 1 otherwise).
%
%   'nlog',...  number of bins per decade for log. discretization (256)
%   'emin',...  minimum energy for omega binning (TN/1000)  ^1)
%   'emax',...  maximum energy for omega binning (10.)      ^1)
%
%  ^1) NB! first (last) bin contains all data below (above) emin (emax)
%
%  Output
%
%    om         omega corresponding to the energy binning [-emax,+emax]
%    A0         raw data for spectral function (i.e. discrete in om)
%
%    Info       info structure: specific fields are
%      .ver     version / mode of code
%      .T       actual temperature used
%      .rho     FDM weight distribution for given temperature
%      .RHO     reduced thermal density matrix for A0 (R-basis).
%      .Om      Omega(T) = -T*log(Z), (grand)canonical potential.
%
%      .A4      individual spectral data for each of the two
%               contributions to the (anti)commutator (hence A4 has
%               twice as many  columns as A0 above).
%
%      .a4      (1st row) integrated spectral integrals over the two
%               individual contributions to the (anti)commutator of
%               given correlator (2nd row may be ignored; it refers
%               to check w.r.t. detailed balance).
%
%      .reA0    contains Re(G(omega->0)) for the calculated correlation
%               functions. Importantly for finite temperatues, the
%               correlators with cflags!=0, i.e. susceptibilities,
%               acquire in addition to the Kramers Kronig transformation
%               (principal value integral!) also a Matsubara correction
%               for Ea==Eb, which would be skipped in the principal
%               value integral; this correction [see Hanl and AW, PRB 2014]
%               is added to the first term in the commutator.
%
%      .symfac  IROP factors for given spectral functions.
%
%  ALTERNATIVE USAGE
%
%  fdmNRG('--mat','nrgdata', 'setup.mat' [,'B'], 'C')
%
%    B and C are the same as above (B=C if B is not specified).
%    This usage allows to read all input parameters from given MAT files
%    (MatLab binaries); all variables and options MUST be defined in
%    <setup.mat> by their names shown above; e.g. the operators B and
%    C are specified by their names as defined in <setup.mat>.
%
%    The output will be written / updated to the file set
%    `<nrgdata>_##.mat' and `<nrgdata>_info.mat'.
%
%    Output will be appended to setup.mat.
